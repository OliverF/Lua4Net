Lua4Net
=======

Lua interface library for .NET  
THIS IS NOT MY OWN WORK  
Original project: https://code.google.com/p/parallel-tasks-simulator/source/browse/trunk/Src/Lua4Net/  
The original author hasn't responded to my request for me to further his/her work. The original was licensed under the MIT license, according to the Google Project site. It was originally created as part of a larger project (Parallel Tasks Simulator), so I've moved the project into its own repository with the intention of making some small updates.
