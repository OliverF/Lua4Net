Lua4Net
=======

Lua interface library for .NET  
The original project is not my own work.  
Original project: https://code.google.com/p/parallel-tasks-simulator/source/browse/trunk/Src/Lua4Net/  
The original was licensed under the MIT license, according to the Google Project site. It was originally created by another developer as part of a larger project (Parallel Tasks Simulator), so I've moved the project into its own repository with the intention of making some small updates.
